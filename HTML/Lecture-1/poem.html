			At last I can be with you! The grinding hours since I left your
			side! The labor of being fully human, working my opposable thumb,
			talking, and walking upright. Now I have unclasped unzipped, stepped
			out of my public habit and stood in my bare feet, blessed as a tree
			in the night air, ready to lie down to you. Do you know when I’m
			alone with you I am more alone with myself than ever? I tell you,
			the world is a knot in my shoelace that won’t slip free, and I must
			sit down, kneel down, take my fingers to it and untie the knot.
